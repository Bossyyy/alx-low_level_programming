for more fuctions more nested loops.
0  checks for uppercase character
1 checks for a digit (0 through 9).
2 multiplies two integers
3 prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
4  prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line Do not print 2 and 4
5 prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
6 function that draws a straight line in the terminal
7 function that draws a diagonal line on the termina
8  function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
9 a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
